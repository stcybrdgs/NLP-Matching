Efficient Phrase Matching
 - raseMatcher like regular expressions or keyword search â€“ but with access to the tokens!
 - Takes Doc object as patterns
 - More efficient and faster than the Matcher
 - Great for matching large word lists
 
 - pumps and ball bearings taxonomies
 - use the taxonomies as new patterns for the matcher
 - consider each product entry to be a separate doc OR
 - make sure the product id and it's description are coupled in 
   sequence, and then take an entire set of product descriptions as a 
   single doc, where the processor uses the ID as a delimiter

 - PhraseMatcher performs keyword search on a doc, but instead
   of only finding strings, it gives you direct access to 
   the tokens in context.
 - PhraseMatcher takes Doc objects as patterns.
 - It is great for matching large dictionaries and word lists
   on large volumes of text.
